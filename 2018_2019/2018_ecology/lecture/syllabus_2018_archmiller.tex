\section{Course Description}

Covers the basic principles of energy and nutrient movement through the ecosystems, the forces that structure ecosystems, and the interactions between organisms and the environment and each other. This course emphasizes quantitative skills. Two lectures and four hours of laboratory per week.

\subsection{Course Goals}

The primary objective of this course is to provide a basis for your understanding of ecology, which includes the complex interactions between organisms and their environment. You will learn to draw together elements from biology, chemistry, physics, geology, and mathematics to gain a greater understanding of ecological relationships in the natural world. The goals of the course are to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Discuss classical and current ecological issues and methodology
	\item Address natural diversity and how humans interact with the environment
	\item Examine biodiversity and sustainability of natural systems
	\item Explore the benefits and limitations of scientific efforts to understand ecological relationships
	\item Critically evaluate environmental issues locally, regionally, and globally
	\item Practice communicating your ecological and scientific knowledge in meaningful and effective ways
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Learning Outcomes}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Access, critically evaluate, and correctly use scientific literature
	\item Classify organizational levels observed in ecology
	\item Explain how populations are regulated and how data can be collected, analyzed, and interpreted using statistics, life tables, graphs, and survivorship curves
	\item Describe the interactions between different species and how they impact one another
	\item Illustrate the major forces responsible for community structure, how community structure can be represented by food webs, and how communities change in both space and time
	\item Discuss patterns and measurements of biodiversity and predict the consequences of continued species loss
	\item Communicate your interpretations, questions, and critiques of the readings with your colleagues during Moodle group discussions
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Required Textbooks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item SimUText Ecology
	\item Carrol, S.B. 2016. \emph{The Serengeti Rules}. Princeton University Press, Princeton. 263pp.
	\item Pollan, M. 2006 \emph{The Omnivore's Dilemma}. Penguin Press, New York. 451pp.
	\item Leopold, A. 1987. \emph{A Sand County Almanac}. Oxford University Press, New York. 228pp.
	\item McMillan, V.E. 2012. \emph{Writing Papers in the Biological Sciences}. 5th ed. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's
	%\item Supplemental material available on Moodle
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attendance Policy}

Regular attendance and participation in class is critical to your success at Concordia College. Because any absence, excused or unexcused, detracts from the learning experience, you are expected to attend all classes. Dr.~ArchMiller also values the educational experience afforded by student participation in co-curricular activities; however, you are responsible for notifying Dr.~ArchMiller of scheduled absences (e.g., co-curricular activities) at the beginning of the semester, or as soon as that information is available (but no less than 24 hours in advance). 

If absences become what Dr.~ArchMiller determines to be excessive (from 10-15\% of classes, without valid college-recognized excuses), points will be deducted from your final percentage. In extreme cases ($>20$\% of classes or 6 unexcused absences), Dr.~ArchMiller will assign a failing grade. \textbf{I strongly recommend that you are present and participate in the class.}

\newthought{Participation} in class and lab will not go towards your grade directly. However, a record throughout the semester of exemplary participation and attendance can help in the case of a borderline final grade. Active participation also nurtures learning, and will improve the quality of future recommendation letters from your instructors.  

\subsection{Accommodations for Students with Disabilities}

In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Concordia College and your instructor are committed to making reasonable accommodations to assist individuals with documented disabilities to reach their academic potential. Such disabilities include, but are not limited to, learning or psychological disabilities, or impairments to health, hearing, sight, or mobility. If you believe you require accommodations for a disability that may impact your performance in this course, you must schedule an appointment with Disability Services to determine eligibility. Students are then responsible for giving instructors a letter from Disability Services indicating the type of accommodation to be provided; please note that accommodations will not be retroactive. The Disability Services office is in Academy 106, phone 218-299-3514; https://www.concordiacollege.edu/directories/offices-services/counseling-center-and-disabilityservices/disability/ 

\subsection{Respect for Diversity}

It is my intent that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you, personally, or for other students or student groups. As a student in this class, you are required to treat other members of the class with respect and kindness. Disrespectful, rude, or exclusive behavior will not be tolerated.

\section{Grades}

%Final grades will be based on the following:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l r}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{fullwidth}

\newthought{SimUText Readings} are from the interactive textbook for this class, and each module has integrated, feedback-focused questions followed by a series of graded questions. \textbf{You are expected to have read that day's SimUText material prior to coming to class. } SimUText graded questions are due by 8:00am on the due date (see schedule).

\textbf{Reading Completion} will be evaluated with the feedback-focused, ungraded questions and will be assessed with a pass-fail grade (completed or not) for each SimUText assignment. 

\begin{margintable}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
Percentage & Grade \\
\hline 
$\ge94$ & A \\
90-93.9 & A- \\
87-89.9 & B+ \\
83-86.9 & B \\
80-82.9 & B- \\

67-69.9 & D+ \\
60-66.9 & D \\
$<60$ & F \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{margintable}


\textbf{Graded Questions} will be worth another 5\% of your final grade; however, the two lowest scores will be dropped before final grades are completed. You may work through the SimUText material with your peers; however, mastering the material is your individual responsibility.



\begin{fullwidth}	

\newthought{{Quizzes}} are designed to quickly check for reading and comprehension of that lecture date's SimUText material. Quizzes will be short ($\sim$3 questions) and given at the beginning of class time on most days. I will drop the two lowest quiz scores.

$^*$In addition, I will make homework available for students that have excused absenses. If you have an excused absense (thus a 0 for that quiz), you may---up to 3 times over the course of the semester---complete homework to replace a zero quiz score. The homework assignments will be designed to give you more hands-on practice with quantitative topics covered in lecture and in the SimUText readings; however, they will be more difficult than quizzes.
	
\newpage 

\newthought{{Lecture Exams}} will be of variable format, including---but not limited to---multiple choice, true/false, matching, short answer, and brief essays. All exams will be somewhat cumulative but will primarily focus on the associated SimUText Unit material (see table above); in addition, the final exam will be one-third cumulative. 
					
												
\newthought{{Group Discussions}} allow you to work as a team of scientists with your colleagues to critically discuss three separate books, \emph{The Serengeti Rules}, \emph{The Omnivore's Dilemma}, and \emph{A Sand County Almanac}. Group discussions will occur in forum format on Moodle. Groups will be assigned at random and will be reassigned for each new book 
(i.e., by October 19 and November 9). 											% change for each year
You will be graded based on the quantity, quality and timing of your comments (see grading rubric below). Each discussion is worth a total of 5 points.

The group as a whole is responsible for completing the assignment; in this case providing a good discussion and coming to a better understanding of ecology and evolution. Everyone should contribute to the discussion, and you are expected to provide at least two comments; ideally one will be an original question or discussion point, and one will be a reply to another group member's comment. You should take this opportunity to learn from and respectfully teach each other.

%\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l}

and you are required to attend. The Symposium Paper should name and summarize the session you attended, including questions/answers raised during the Q/A of the session, and your reaction. At least one page of your paper should explore how the symposia relate to ecology, the environment and campus life. You will be graded out of 100 points based on the following (detailed rubric is on Moodle): 

\begin{itemize}
\item Spelling and grammar (20pts)
\item Summary of session and Q/As (40pts)
%\item Relation of session topic to ecology and the environment (30pts)
\item Relation of session topic to campus life and science (40pts)
\end{itemize}

%\newthought{\textbf{Homework}} will be designed to give you more hands-on practice with quantitative topics covered in lecture and in the SimUText readings. The due date and timewill be specified on each homework assignment.

\subsection{Biology Department policy on use of electronic devices (phones, smart watches, laptops, tablets, etc.)}

Faculty in the Biology Department work to make the classroom and laboratory a space conducive to student learning. We encourage writing notes by hand because it is an effective learning strategy for many students. However, the Biology Department also understands the valuable role of electronic devices in learning and scholarship. Thus, the Biology Department policy on the use of these devices in the classroom is as follows:


\begin{enumerate}
\item Electronic devices used during class time should be limited to appropriate class-related activities as outlined by the instructor. We reserve the right to check devices at any time and to ask you to put them away or leave if we see you using them inappropriately. Please reduce distractions to yourself and your fellow classmates.
\item All electronic devices must be set to silent during scheduled classroom and laboratory sessions. Tones and vibrations are distracting.
\item Only approved electronic devices (such as non-programmable calculators) may be available or used during examination periods. We expect that all non-approved electronic devices will be turned off and stored away from the exam areas.
\item Sharing calculators during exams is not allowed without permission. 
\item Cheating in any form, including through use of an electronic device, will not be tolerated. See the academic integrity policy for more information.
\end{enumerate}

Inappropriate or distracting use of electronic devices in the classroom may adversely affect your course grade.
