\color{blue} \newthought{Condensed Class Schedule:} This is a full-semester, 3-credit course that is condensed into 9 weeks. That means that this class will be very fast-paced, and you will need to keep up on the readings to succeed in this class!  I will be emailing you with reminders, but we do not meet as a class over Zoom or in person. You will be responsible for making time to read, watch videos, and complete labs in your own time.

\section{Course Description}

During this course, students will learn about all life on Earth, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. We will study interactions between humans and the planet, as well as dynamic changes on Earth and how they impact life. This course will cover how life has changed over geologic time, and the evolutionary processes that determine new species and relationships among organisms.

%\subsection{Learning Outcomes}

By the end of this course, students should be able to:  

\begin{enumerate}
	\item distinguish between deductive and inductive reasoning and explain the scientific method
	\item describe different types of ecosystems and niches
	\item explain how evolution occursâ€™ and provide examples of evolutionary relationships among organisms
	\item list homologous structures that humans share with different animals
	\item interpret an evolutionary phylogeny
	\item gain understanding of how the changing planet impacts the biosphere
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Required Textbooks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Edward O. Wilson, Diversity of Life, (1992). Publisher: Harvard University Press.
	\item Neil Shubin, Your Inner Fish (2009). Publisher: Random House.
	\item SimUText Online textbook. Must purchase and download software to complete the labs. Link provided on D2L

\newthought{Video Reflections} are 2-3 sentence reflections that you will write in response to watching videos on D2L. These videos will show scientific case studies that relate to course material. Each reflection must include 2-3 complete sentences that you write in your own words. Each sentence should start with one of our starter phrases, which are listed below. You will be graded on your grammar and punctuation and on your ability to show that you watched the video (specific details, etc).
