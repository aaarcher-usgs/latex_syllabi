\section{Course Description}

Organisms at the cellular, organismal, and ecological levels. Integrate knowledge, terminology, and concepts from all fields of biology to gain an appreciation of the origin of life and how species diversity arose.

\subsection{Learning Outcomes}

The goals of the course are to:


\begin{enumerate}
	%\item Access, critically evaluate, and correctly use scientific literature
	\item Learn enough about biology to allow you to make informed decisions about some of the important issues concerning biology that face society today
	\item Begin to develop an understanding of science, its scope, and its limitations
	\item Begin to develop an appreciation of both the incredible diversity and the unity of life, of which humans are one part
	\item Develop a knowledge and conceptual base in the areas of diversity, evolution, and ecology
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Required Textbooks}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Biology. Raven. 12th edition. Do not purchase individually, instead sign up through D2L. More information will be shared soon
	\item McMillan, V.E. 2014 or later. \emph{Writing Papers in the Biological Sciences}. Bedford/St.\ Martin's
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Email and Phone Policy}

\newthought{Contact Us:} The best way to get ahold of us is by emailing us. We will always try to get back to emails within 24 hours or 48 hours, if it is a weekend. We get a lot of emails, so please begin emails with ``BIOL 152'' so that we can prioritize your email. 

\newthought{Regular attendance and participation in class is critical to your success.} This course will be offered in a synchronous Zoom format. Textbook assignments will be conducted through an interactive online textbook. Lectures slides will be posted to D2L. 


\newthought{Accommodations for Students with Disabilities: } SCSU is an affirmative action, equal opportunity employer and educator. We are committed to a policy of nondiscrimination in employment and education opportunity and work to provide reasonable accommodations for all persons with disabilities. Accommodations are provided on an individualized, as-needed basis, determined through appropriate documentation of need. Please contact Student Accessibility Services (SAS), sas@stcloudstate.edu or 320-308-4080, Centennial Hall 202, to meet and discuss reasonable and appropriate accommodations. 

\newthought{Respect for Diversity: } It is our intent that students from diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you, personally, or for other students or student groups. As a student in this class, you are required to treat other members of the class with respect and kindness. Diverse perspectives are welcome and disagreeing is fine. However, disrespectful, rude, or exclusive behavior will not be tolerated.

\newthought{{Lecture Exams}} will be comprised of multiple choice questions and will be conducted via D2L. The first three exams will primarily focus on the associated unit material. The final exam will be $\sim$25\% cumulative. 




\newthought{Laboratory} grades will be based around a semester-long project and participation in Zoom lab sessions. Please see laboratory syllabus for more information. 


\newthought{St.\ Cloud's Statement on Covid-19}

St. Cloud State University (SCSU), in coordination with state and local health departments, is closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and following the State of Minnesotaâ€™s laws and guidelines to keep everyone safe.
